POSIX compatible Installer for OpenTox IST/ALU Services
=======================================================

Author: Andreas Maunz
This is a POSIX-compliant (not limited to a particular shell) OpenTox required packages installer for Debian. It also prepares the base directory (referred to as OT_PREFIX) for OpenTox REST services and provides libraries for the installation and shell integration of those services. 
Please report bugs via GitHub at http://github.com/opentox/install.

Here are some of my goals when writing the installer:
- Safe (existence of all binaries will be checked before running, apart from GNU Core Utils)
- Idempotent (multiple execution incurs no changes to the system)
- Atomic (return value of non-elementary actions asserted to be TRUE)
- Encapsulated (everything installed in OT_PREFIX; applies to services)
- Logged (all non-elementary actions are logged)

Requirements:
A) Debian or compatible (tested on Debian 6.0.5).
B) Users may gain root privileges using 'sudo'.

Usage:
Detailed installation instructions for developers can be found here:

You can run multiple Opentox versions on the same machine: Just install again as a different user.
