POSIX compatible Installer for OpenTox IST/ALU Services on Debian based systems
===============================================================================

POSIX-compliant (not limited to a particular shell) installer. Report bugs via GitHub.

- Safe (existence of all the binaries will be checked before running, apart from GNU Core Utils)
- Idempotent (multiple execution does not change a thing)
- Atomic (return value of each non-elemtary action is asserted to be TRUE)
- Encapsulated (everything is installed in a sub-directory in $HOME)
- Logged (all non-elemtary actions are logged)

A) sudo configuration to gain root privileges assumed (needed only for installation).
B) configuration for non-free packages assumed.

Configure in config.sh, see comments there.
By default, everything is installed to $HOME/opentox-ruby (=OT_PREFIX). 
The configs go to OT_PREFIX/.sh_<Package>_ot.sh for each package.

After installation, configure the system by editing the startup file of your favorite shell (in BASH 
the file '~/.bashrc') to include '~/install/ot-tools-user.sh' (in BASH with 'source ~/install/ot-tools-user.sh').
If you now open a new shell and type otconfig, all environment variables are adjusted automatically.

IMPORTANT workaround: before using the system for the first time:
Open a shell, otconfig, otkill, gem uninstall rack, and uninstall the latest version (1.4.1), otstart.

To uninstall the system simply delete the link from the startup file (e.g. '~/.bashrc'). 
To save disk space delete directory OT_PREFIX.
Anyone can run multiple Opentox versions on the same machine: Install again as a different user.

Usage
=====
Start a shell

Start the system: otstart
Reload the system: otreload
Kill the system: otkill

Configure shell manually: otconfig
