POSIX compatible Installer for OpenTox IST/ALU Services
=======================================================

A) It is assumed that your system is configured for sudo to gain root privileges.
B) It is assumed that your system is configured for using non-free packages.

This is a POSIX-compliant  (not limited to a particular shell) Opentox installer. Please report bugs always via GitHub.

Here are some of my goals when writing the installer:
- Safe (existence of all the binaries will be checked before running, apart from GNU Core Utils)
- idempotent (multiple execution does not change a thing)
- Atomic (return value of each non-elemtary action is asserted to be TRUE)
- Encapsulated (everything is installed in a sub-directory in $HOME)
- Logged (all non-elemtary actions are logged)

Even if we officially support only *one* distro (currently Debian 6.0.1), I tested the installer successfully on various Ubuntus. In the README at the top are the requirements of the installer. By default, everything is installed to $HOME/opentox-ruby (=OT_PREFIX). The configs go OT_PREFIX/.sh_<Package>_ot.sh for each package.

After running the installer, configure the operating system by editing the startup file of your favorite shell (in my case, BASH with to the file ~ /. bashrc) include file ~/.opentox-ui.sh (in my case with 'source ...'). This file is the only one that the installer creates outside OT_PREFIX. Thus, the system is fully configured: If you open a new shell, all environment variables adjusted.

To start the system I run the following (but that is not part of the installer):
Edit ~/.opentox/config/production.yaml and change ": server: nil" to "server" (once)
sudo nohup ~/opentox-ruby/redis-2.2.2/src/redis-server ~/opentox-ruby/redis-2.2.2/redis.conf &
sudo nohup ~/opentox-ruby/nginx/sbin/nginx -c ~/opentox-ruby/nginx/conf/nginx.conf &

To uninstall the system simply delete the link from the startup file: Done. I guarantee that no configuration remains. To save disc space delete directory OT_PREFIX.

Anyone who wants can run multiple Opentox versions on the same machine: Just install again, but to a different OT_PREFIX. The switch works manually: Include the sh_<Package>_ot.sh files from the desired OT_PREFIX in ~/opentox-ui.sh (only one installation may be activated  at any time).
