POSIX compatible Installer for OpenTox IST/ALU Services
=======================================================

Author: Andreas Maunz
This is a POSIX-compliant  (not limited to a particular shell) Opentox installer. Please report bugs via GitHub.

Requirements:
A) Debian or compatible (only 'base-install.sh')
B) Your system is configured for 'sudo'.

Here are some of my goals when writing the installer:
- Safe (existence of all the binaries will be checked before running, apart from GNU Core Utils)
- Idempotent (multiple execution does not change anything)
- Atomic (return value of each non-elemtary action is asserted to be TRUE)
- Encapsulated (everything is installed in a sub-directory in $HOME)
- Logged (all non-elemtary actions are logged)

Usage:
Configure your system in config.sh. Then run 'install'

Even if officially only *one* distro (currently Debian 6.0.1) is supported, I tested the installer successfully on various Ubuntus. Find the requirements at the top of this file. By default, everything is installed to $HOME/opentox-ruby (OT_PREFIX).

After running the installer, configure the system by editing the startup file of your favorite shell (in my case, BASH with the file ~/.bashrc) to include ~/OT_PREFIX/.opentox-ui.sh (in my case with 'source ...'). OT_PREFIX is the only directory the installer creates. Thus, the system is fully configured: If you now open a new shell, all environment variables will be adjusted.

To uninstall the system simply delete the link from the startup file: Done. To save disc space delete also directory OT_PREFIX.

You can run multiple Opentox versions on the same machine: Just install again, but to a different OT_PREFIX. The switch: Include the opentox-ui.sh files from the desired OT_PREFIX (only one installation may be activated at a time).
